Game Designer

Game Designers love to create new gaming experiences. Sometimes your standard Slayer or Capture the Flag game modes are nice, but that doesn't mean there isn't another big thing around the corner like Strongholds. Whether it is experimenting to create a new mode like Breakout with unique environments to make it work, or it is doing a one off mini-game like Sumo, Game Designers are all about the game mechanics. Without Game Designers, we would be stuck with the same three game modes over and over again.

 - Add to the Mindbox with new game experience ideas, no matter how small
 - Brainstorm with team to build up new ideas that are underdeveloped
 - Use other games as inspiration; not just other shooters, but games like Braid, Candy Crush, or Chess
 - Manage a Game Design document detailing every detail of the game and every possible variation that can be thought of; keeping track of successes, failures, and other analysis
 - Determine the feasibility of the game experience in the Halo engine; what must the gametype sacrifice to work?
 - If this is a standard game mode that can be made with multiple maps, what would you do if you were 343 and could create objectives, settings, and UI for the mode?
 - Find the fun


Level Designer

 > Matt

Level Designers are puzzle makers in the first person shooter genre. They figure out what mix of traversal, threat, risk, opportunity, etc. go into making an environment an enjoyable experience. They can tell you what areas of an environment are vulnerable to what other areas, the advantages of traversing to the area, and how frequently traffic is expected in the area. Level Designers constantly manage a web of connections in their mind and are masters of interaction. They understand that while players may come for the aesthetics, they stay for the gameplay. Without Level Designers, we might as well make aesthetic maps and never pull them up in lobbies.

 - Add to the Sandbox with new ideas for layouts
 - Understand the current state of map market; understanding what types of maps are oversaturated and what are under developed
 - Create compelling experiences that make you want to play over and over; especially on a map that is made completely of primitives and isn't pleasing to look at
 - Sketch out initial designs
 - Blockout layout; don't worry about map exploits, art, or cleanliness... just make sure it is playable
 - Work with the community and the Quality Assurance Hosts to get testing on your Blockouts until it feels like gold
 - Work with an Environment Artist to evolve the map into a work of art while maintaining the key gameplay elements that make the experience fun
 - Continue to test as art is applied to ensure maintaining gameplay quality


Environment Artist

 > James

Environment Artists bring worlds to life. They understand how to make jaws drop and how to make the area around you just as interesting as the other players. Whether it is lighting, landmarks, color, effects, architecture, etc. an Environment Artist seeks to master the art of creating imagination and wonder. It's an Environment Artist's job to make people double take and download as well as ensure that the moment they step into the environment, their first impression of the world is absolutely mesmerizing... enabling players to have a wonderful experience. Without Environment Artists, nobody will take the time to even look at us... nobody wants to play in a pile of a 4 year old's lego set.

 - Add to the Aesthetic Proofs with new potential styles and environments
 - Work with the team to decide on art directions for projects
 - Pick up refined blockouts and turn them into a works of art
 - Explore unique art styles, environments, and worlds in other games, books, or film
 - Perfect the skills required for the Forge engine; understanding the tricks of lighting, coloring, and cohesion
 - Create prefabricated objects that will speed up your workflow;
 - Create entire object palettes for art styles even if they are not needed; making future development faster and easier


Community Coordinator
 > Alex

Community Coordinators ensure that the team is represented in the best light while maintaining an honest level of transparency. Community Coordinators make sure that the team is being recognized by the community, building the brand of the team in the best way possible. They make sure that the community is aware of the team's hard work even if nothing is being released. Without Community Coordinators, our content would be shunned by everyone as an inexperienced forger.

 - Work on regular write ups to put out to the community in the form of small updates (tweets) and large updates (progress updates)
 - Be aware of every part of the process that the team does work in and know what is happening at all times
 - Recognize opportunities to bring attention to the team; know what is shareable and interesting to the community
 - Assist in managing the release of content to the community in manageable output levels
 - Ensure that every member of the team is recognized on the outside for their value to the team (Writers, Screenshot Editors, etc. are just as valuable to the team as Level Designers and Environment Artists)


Quality Assurance Host
 > Xandar
 > Crypto

Quality Assurance Hosts focus on ensuring that the team's content is regularly going through testing and receiving feedback. Most of the team are busy working on various projects and have little time to build a network and testing crew. QA Hosts are all about making friends to build their network and ensure that they can test whenever they need to. Without QA Hosts our ability to put out quality content is extremely lacking.

 - Regularly run lobbies to get testing on the various projects that need testing
 - Relay a summary of feedback from testing sessions
 - If possible record testing sessions for viewing later
 - Expand network of testers; this will ensure that it is easy to pull together a testing session
 - Be a fair and considerate host; ensure that participating testers are getting their content tested next to our own
 - Explore how to make relaying feedback and gathering testers a much more efficient endeavor


Manager
 > Carson
 > Connor
 > Ray

Managers do not force the team to do what they want. Managers ensure that every member of the team can do their job better. They make sure that the content pipeline is managed in a way that enables more content to come through while also reducing the stress of the team. An understanding of project management and agile methodologies are part of a manager's immense skill set. They understand that forcing people to work isn't the best way to increase output. Managers are to be your best friend, they have a good set of general knowledge and know where to point you when you run into problems. Without Managers the team would have no organization and nothing would get done.

 - Keep track of the amount of content being worked on at all times
 - Notice when a bottleneck is forming before it becomes a major problem
 - Assist in the decisions of the future direction of the team
 - Keep an eye on when a team member is not being supported enough and find ways to alleviate the issue
 - Onboard new members; filling them in on the process, the culture, and the details
 - Make nice with external teams and resources to enable options for the team


Tools Engineer
 > Matt
 > Ray
 > Connor

Tools Engineers are the wizards of the team. They take something that used to take you an hour and manipulate time so that it only consumes 5 minutes instead. A Tools Engineer is a lazy person that has grown to realize that their laziness is a super power that enables them to be a person of many shortcuts. A good Tools Engineer understands the majority of the process and invents ways to make it better. Without Tools Engineers we would not increase our velocity and instead slow to a halt as the number of things that need to be done grows.

 - Administer the core software used by the team (Slack, Trello, etc.)
 - Get an understanding of the entire process; enabling a visibility into what may be useful
 - Learn to build software well; this may not be so easy
 - Explore the process of other industries and find ways to optimize our own team's processes with that
 - Actually build tools that will bring about the saving of time; even if one of those tools is just a spreadsheet with data


Creative/Technical Writer
 > Christian
 > Alex

Creative/Technical Writers bring our content to life. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but a Writer knows how to influence those words and steer the converstaion in the proper direction. The Creatives spin worlds of mystery, making players want to consume the content and explore it while Technicals give the information that matters most. Without Writers, our work has no context and no life.

 - Ensure that projects have write-ups prepared for publishing; this includes content summaries, descriptions, interviews, etc.
 - Make sure the team is providing all of the info that is needed for a write up
 - Work with Screenshot Editors to coordinate writeups with appropriate media content
 - Work with Community Coordinators to provide content for regular public updates
 - Provide editing skills to design documents, reviews, feedback, updates, etc.


Innovation Developer
 > Ray
 > Carson
 > Connor

Innovation Developers are the mad scientists of the team. They love to experiment and prove to the world that things are possible. They are familiar with the ins and outs of a system ensuring that they have every possible tool they could need to solve a problem. Others don't have time or motivation to explore, but Innovation Developers will test and test and test until they make it work. Without Innovation Developers dreams don't come true and are shrugged off as must "magic".

 - Fill the Mindbox with crazy ideas that you believe are achievable
 - Assist Game Designers in making their crazy ideas actually feasible
 - Build and design mechanisms that can be used by the rest of the team
 - Find the most efficient way to solve a problem in game
 - Discover new techniques that may provide new possibilities
 - Feed the Game Designers with your discoveries to trigger sparks of imagination
 - Document findings in an easily consumable manner and publish them to the public


Screenshot Editor
 > Blaze

Screenshot Editors are our photographers. They understand what makes a good picture and how to enhance it in a way that speaks to the world. They are our first line of defense against the critics of the world. They seek to say more than an entire album with a single shot. Without Screenshot Editors our content are judged with the worst of book covers.

 - Take pictures of content at various stages of the process
 - Build albums that tell a story of how a piece of content came to light
 - Possess or desire the skills to manipulate images to bring them to perfection
 - Provide media for tutorials, writeups, events, etc.
 - Understand photography on a deeper level beyond "pretty"


Video Editor
 > Carson

Video Editors create engaging media that makes players drool for more. Their editing is seamless, their experience is wide, and their willingness to improve is second to none. Videos are one of the most engaging pieces of media available in this day in age and a Video Editor knows how to compete with cat videos. Without Video Editors our content presentation is nearly motionless and cowers in comparison to others with videos.



Film Director
 > Connor
 > Randy

Film Directors love the epic moments of a match and they know how to capture the intensity of the action. A Film Director's intense OCD on getting just the right shot is unmatched. They will rewind, record, and rewind again until they get just the right angle. They are a collector of no scopes and triple kills, a librarian of awesome moments, and a master of angles. Without Film Directors our videos could exist, or just end up being a single recorded match.
