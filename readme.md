The Original Problem
---

Since the introduction of Halo's content editor Forge, content created by the community has been mostly a solo process. A single individual (Forger) would:

 - Have an idea
 - Brainstorm the idea
 - Sketch out the idea
 - Build a prototype
 - Test the prototype
 - Decide on art direction
 - Apply art to the prototype
 - Post development progress in communities
 - Do quality assurance testing
 - Apply polish to gameplay and art
 - Create a writeup for sharing
 - Create media for sharing
 - Post the content to communities
 - Market the content to communities

This was seen as normal for years. Some projects would introduce co-forgers that would share those responsibilitiess to make this process easier. The entire process required a multitude of skills and introduced multiple chances for a project to get "stuck" and never reach completion. In addition, having to focus on multiple different skills made it diffcult to perfect each step of the process.
