**Creative Force** [CF] is a product development team founded by **Raymond
Benefield**, focused on building user generated content for the Halo series.

The Original Problem
---

Since the introduction of Halo's content editor Forge, content created by the community has been mostly a solo process. A single individual (Forger) would:

 - Have an idea
 - Brainstorm the idea
 - Sketch out the idea
 - Build a prototype
 - Test the prototype
 - Decide on art direction
 - Apply art to the prototype
 - Share development progress in communities
 - Do quality assurance testing
 - Apply polish to gameplay and art
 - Create a writeup for sharing
 - Create media for sharing
 - Publish the content to communities
 - Market the content to social media
 - Maintain updates

This was seen as normal for years. Some projects would introduce co-forgers that would share those responsibilitiess to make this process easier. The entire process required a multitude of skills and introduced multiple chances for a project to get "stuck" and never reach completion. In addition, having to focus on multiple different skills made it diffcult to perfect each step of the process. As a result quality, stress, completed projects, and time to market were at subpar levels.

The Proposed Solution
---

**Raymond Benefield** saw an opportunity to improve this process by introducing true collaboration and creating a content pipeline that encouraged individuals to take ownership of parts of the process rather than entire projects. The goal was to introduce roles of packaged responsibilities that would allow individuals to specialize in their field of study while working with other individuals to see projects through to completion. Similar to how the gaming industry is structured. The core responsibilities were split up into two key positions:

 - Level Designer: Responsible strictly for improving the gameplay experience. They specialize in designing map layouts, perfecting combat interactions, understanding game mechanics, and fine tuning user interaction experience.
 - Environment Artist: Responsible strictly for the visual experience. They specialize in introducing atmosphere, creating immersion, leveraging development tools, and understanding fidelity in user visual experience.

The remaining responsibilities were split into supporting roles that support the Designers and Artists:

 - Creative/Technical Writers: Responsible for generating required writeups and editing of documentation for content. They specialize in generating documentation, writing compelling stories, and producing publishing writeups for marketing purposes.
 - Media Specialists: Responsible for handling the presentation of the content. They specialize in perfecting screenshots, generating publishing media, and enticing consumers.
 - Product Managers: Responsible for coordinating between various roles. They specialize in discovering bottlenecks, maximizing individual interactions, and guiding projects towards completion.
 - Tools Engineers: Responsible for managing and creating tools to optimize the content pipeline. They specialize in knowing available tool solutions, leveraging tools for productivity, and creating new tools tailored for the process.

The Original Process (Oct '15 - Sept '16)
---

The original process that **Creative Force** followed was inspired by Scrum and KanBan agile methodoligies. Content was planned out over two weeks sprints. 2-4 projects would hold the focus of the sprint, progressing them to the next major step in their process. At the end of each of these sprints, content progress was recorded and analyzed and adjustments were made to the process. The 2-4 projects were either bringing a project from the Backlog to Beta or taking a Beta to full Release.

Each project has owned by two individuals, the Designer and the Artist. Each project began as an idea by the Designer, that is built up in a pure prototype form (a bland aesthetic is enforced), and tested to gameplay satisfaction in an Alpha state. When the project becomes immersive and fun, despite being visually lacking, it is deemed ready for art and waits in a Backlog. Before each sprint, artists would go through the Backlog and pick a project that they were interested in and work with the Designer to pick an art direction for the project. When the sprint started, they would take that project and apply the art direction to the best of their ability as time was allowed bringing it to a Beta state. At the Beta state the content would be partially published to the public and tested with the community. During the Beta state, in a future sprint the Artist and Designer would re-pick up the project to polish out feedback and details until it was ready for release. At this point, the supporting roles would assist in generating writeups and media in order to market the content and publish it.

This process removed many of the issues of working as a solo Forger and broke the boundaries of ownership. Over the years it was observed that a single individual owning a project could not be supported by a team. This was due to the fact that supporting a project owned by a single person resulted in individuals feeling like they were working for that forger. This resulted in a loss in motivation and eventually there would be no support system to push projects forward. Having two individuals owning a major piece of each project (Designer owning Gameplay, and Artist owning Visuals) introduced two players that had an investment in the project, so when one waivered the other could pick it up and continue the momentum until the first was ready to pursue again. This helped bring things to completion, but the original process was not optimal for this partnership as it resulted in the Artist shouldering a majority of the work which resulted in ownership problems since the Designer and Artist now had lopsided investments into the project.

The Second Process (Sept '16 - Present)
---

With observed issues in the original process a new process was designed based on the experiences gained from the original process. This new process had a goal of splitting owernship even further from a partnership into a full team ownership. In order to accomplish this the original partnership roles (the Designer and Artist) would serve as Leadership roles rather than workhorses. The goals of the refined process include having the Designer lay the groundwork for the gameplay and have the team support the completion of the design, and then having the Artist lay the groundwork for the art and have the team support the completion of the art. In order to do this, parts of the process had to change to be more definition instead of completion.

Each stage of content was given a more defined purpose:

 - Idea [Existence]: Focus on exploring an idea to its limit.
 - Prototype [Acknowledgement]: Focus on bringing a project to a playable state.
 - Alpha [Soul]: Focus on perfecting a project's gameplay.
 - Beta [Identity]: Focus on defining an aesthetic without detailing.
 - Release [Style]: Focus on perfecting the art direction.

The shift in focus for each stage should result in more concrete work that enables projects to be focused on by the entire team at certain stages by using supporting designers and supporting artists to bring a project through to completion.

The general team workflow process remains similar with different goals. Projects will still be tracked in two week sprints. Instead of each sprint focusing on 2-4 projects owned by 2-4 different partnerships, instead a single project will be owned by the team to bring it from completed Beta to full Release. With the art direction being fully defined in the Beta stage, the team is now empowered to follow that direction asynchronously from the Lead Artist removing the original bottleneck and heavy investment from the Lead Artist. As a secondary goal projects working towards the intial playability state will also be worked on by the team as many of these new ideas require multiple minds to get it functional.
