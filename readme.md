**Creative Force** [CF] is a product development team founded by **Raymond
Benefield**, focused on building user generated content for the Halo series.

The Original Problem
---

Since the introduction of Halo's content editor Forge, content created by the community has been mostly a solo process. A single individual (Forger) would:

 - Have an idea
 - Brainstorm the idea
 - Sketch out the idea
 - Build a prototype
 - Test the prototype
 - Decide on art direction
 - Apply art to the prototype
 - Share development progress in communities
 - Do quality assurance testing
 - Apply polish to gameplay and art
 - Create a writeup for sharing
 - Create media for sharing
 - Publish the content to communities
 - Market the content to social media
 - Maintain updates

This was seen as normal for years. Some projects would introduce co-forgers that would share those responsibilitiess to make this process easier. The entire process required a multitude of skills and introduced multiple chances for a project to get "stuck" and never reach completion. In addition, having to focus on multiple different skills made it diffcult to perfect each step of the process. As a result quality, stress, completed projects, and time to market were at subpar levels.

The Proposed Solution
---

**Raymond Benefield** saw an opportunity to improve this process by introducing true collaboration and creating a content pipeline that encouraged individuals to take ownership of parts of the process rather than entire projects. The goal was to introduce roles of packaged responsibilities that would allow individuals to specialize in their field of study while working with other individuals to see projects through to completion. Similar to how the gaming industry is structured. The core responsibilities were split up into two key positions:

 - Level Designer: Responsible strictly for improving the gameplay experience. They specialize in designing map layouts, perfecting combat interactions, understanding game mechanics, and fine tuning user interaction experience.
 - Environment Artist: Responsible strictly for the visual experience. They specialize in introducing atmosphere, creating immersion, leveraging development tools, and understanding fidelity in user visual experience.

The remaining responsibilities were split into supporting roles that support the Designers and Artists:

 - Creative/Technical Writers: Responsible for generating required writeups and editing of documentation for content. They specialize in generating documentation, writing compelling stories, and producing publishing writeups for marketing purposes.
 - Media Specialists: Responsible for handling the presentation of the content. They specialize in perfecting screenshots, generating publishing media, and enticing consumers.
 - Product Managers: Responsible for coordinating between various roles. They specialize in discovering bottlenecks, maximizing individual interactions, and guiding projects towards completion.
 - Tools Engineers: Responsible for managing and creating tools to optimize the content pipeline. They specialize in knowing available tool solutions, leveraging tools for productivity, and creating new tools tailored for the process.

Difficulties
---

In order for the proposed solution to succeed, many factors need to be kept in mind. All of these difficulties are in addition to the normal difficulties that startups will typically have.

 - The most important thing to keep in mind is that every Forger is doing this development in their free time. Because there is no financial incentive, getting a full team of individuals working in their free time will be extremely difficult.
 - Forgers have a history of working on their own. Very few individuals are mentally prepared to work with others in a collaborative environment.
 - Ownership will become a huge issue as most Forgers are used to owning an entire project from start to finish and as a result are used to being personally tied to their decisions. This will result in conflict of ownership from time to time. This also introduces problems with ego and having projects be tied to a team rather than individuals reducing some of the incentive.
 - Because of the mostly solo process, this is pioneering new territory for splitting up the process into a content pipeline. This isn't exactly game development or standard product development so processes will need to be truly customized for this system to work.
 - Without financial incentive enticing individuals to perform support tasks rather than development tasks will be extremely difficult as the amount of recognition they receive will be very little.
 - Timing group collaboration will be diffuclt. The process needs to be mostly asynchronous, allowing forgers to work separately from each other.
 - Tools are limited. Halo development happened originally mostly on the Xbox. Due to this the potential for integrations with tools is pretty much non-existent. Our best bet is to eventually tap into the Halo API.
 - There are no undo tools or version control systems in place which make collaboration extremely difficult, requiring a level of trust that doesn't normally exist in the community for fear of other individuals not being as knowledgeable.
 - Project management and development organization is non-existent in the current forging process. It goes as far as creating a WIP thread or posting some screenshots in a "What are you working on?" Thread (WAYWO). So new tools will have a learning curve for most forgers.
 - Expect very little official support from the developers of Halo (343 Industries). Favoritism is not something we want to give off as a reason for succeeding. We want to succeed on our own merits, not based on our connections and friends.
 - With little financial support we need to work pretty much explicitly in the domain of free tools. This extremely limits possibilities for integration of tools between each other as most integrations require a subscription. Especially since most tools are a per user model.
 - Because this team is strictly based on free time effort, we also have to be able to handle when other responsibilities come into play. Projects need to be easily passed on to others and the as a whole needs to be in control of content. Projects cannot have a single point of failure (as well as supporting material such as publishing templates).
 - Forging is a hobby of passion, and not being able to properly fuel that passion will result in a drop in project participation. Progression goals need to be flexible enough to keep forgers interested as well as remain focused enough to complete projects.
 - The entire process that makes the team work in the end will be a complex set of rules, processes, and truths. This process must remain documented and up-to-date so each individual remains on the same page.
 - There is no guarantee that any individual will have any real world experience with working on a team for content creation and as a result, many individuals may actually be as young as young teens (12+). This requires attention to building an individual's maturity level.
 - Due to the nature of online game playing, this team inherits all difficulties that come with being a remotely located team.

The Original Process (Oct '15 - Sept '16)
---

The original process that **Creative Force** followed was inspired by Scrum and KanBan agile methodoligies. Content was planned out over two weeks sprints. 2-4 projects would hold the focus of the sprint, progressing them to the next major step in their process. At the end of each of these sprints, content progress was recorded and analyzed and adjustments were made to the process. The 2-4 projects were either bringing a project from the Backlog to Beta or taking a Beta to full Release.

Each project has owned by two individuals, the Designer and the Artist. Each project began as an idea by the Designer, that is built up in a pure prototype form (a bland aesthetic is enforced), and tested to gameplay satisfaction in an Alpha state. When the project becomes immersive and fun, despite being visually lacking, it is deemed ready for art and waits in a Backlog. Before each sprint, artists would go through the Backlog and pick a project that they were interested in and work with the Designer to pick an art direction for the project. When the sprint started, they would take that project and apply the art direction to the best of their ability as time was allowed bringing it to a Beta state. At the Beta state the content would be partially published to the public and tested with the community. During the Beta state, in a future sprint the Artist and Designer would re-pick up the project to polish out feedback and details until it was ready for release. At this point, the supporting roles would assist in generating writeups and media in order to market the content and publish it.

This process removed many of the issues of working as a solo Forger and broke the boundaries of ownership. Over the years it was observed that a single individual owning a project could not be supported by a team. This was due to the fact that supporting a project owned by a single person resulted in individuals feeling like they were working for that forger. This resulted in a loss in motivation and eventually there would be no support system to push projects forward. Having two individuals owning a major piece of each project (Designer owning Gameplay, and Artist owning Visuals) introduced two players that had an investment in the project, so when one waivered the other could pick it up and continue the momentum until the first was ready to pursue again. This helped bring things to completion, but the original process was not optimal for this partnership as it resulted in the Artist shouldering a majority of the work which resulted in ownership problems since the Designer and Artist now had lopsided investments into the project.

The Second Process (Sept '16 - Present)
---

With observed issues in the original process a new process was designed based on the experiences gained from the original process. This new process had a goal of splitting owernship even further from a partnership into a full team ownership. In order to accomplish this the original partnership roles (the Designer and Artist) would serve as Leadership roles rather than workhorses. The goals of the refined process include having the Designer lay the groundwork for the gameplay and have the team support the completion of the design, and then having the Artist lay the groundwork for the art and have the team support the completion of the art. In order to do this, parts of the process had to change to be more definition instead of completion.

Each stage of content was given a more defined purpose:

 - Idea [Existence]: Focus on exploring an idea to its limit.
 - Prototype [Acknowledgement]: Focus on bringing a project to a playable state.
 - Alpha [Soul]: Focus on perfecting a project's gameplay.
 - Beta [Identity]: Focus on defining an aesthetic without detailing.
 - Release [Style]: Focus on perfecting the art direction.

The shift in focus for each stage should result in more concrete work that enables projects to be focused on by the entire team at certain stages by using supporting designers and supporting artists to bring a project through to completion.

The general team workflow process remains similar with different goals. Projects will still be tracked in two week sprints. Instead of each sprint focusing on 2-4 projects owned by 2-4 different partnerships, instead a single project will be owned by the team to bring it from completed Beta to full Release. With the art direction being fully defined in the Beta stage, the team is now empowered to follow that direction asynchronously from the Lead Artist removing the original bottleneck and heavy investment from the Lead Artist. As a secondary goal projects working towards the intial playability state will also be worked on by the team as many of these new ideas require multiple minds to get it functional.
