Original Philosophy
---

Creative Force's original philosophy was based on giving ownership to two individuals for a project in order to promote a shared investment. These two individuals had a lot on their shoulder to get things done. Stages were also loosely defined from Alpha to Release. Maps would sit in Beta stage for months and only get attention from the Artist and maybe the Designer as the Designer found time. Many tools like texturing, foliage, etc. didn't exist in the first iterations of forge. With these new tools we can evolve our process and better define each stage.

The original philosophy had many issues. The biggest of which was that there were no clear end goals for a Beta and it became a bottleneck and a stage of question. With Betas that sat there forever, the Release became unimportant. At the point where a Beta had sat there for months, it would be decided to push it to Release in an almost identical form to the Beta. In addition the amount of burden on the Artists shoulder to get it to Beta was immense and daunting and made many people quit for a while. Projects didn't feel like team projects, unless some deadline or good will was thrown the project's way. This also caused a large amount of ownership tied to the Artist due to the amount of work that was put into the Beta, causing issues of credibility and an unappreciation of effort for the Artist.

In addition there were issues in how we interfaced with the community. The team comes off as being idle because all projects sit in an internal state throughout the entire Beta with no announcement to the community until **MONTHS** after the project is started. This had a huge effect on team morale as work was not being recognized. This also resulted in minimal feedback from the community being integrated into final projects.

What was discovered over the course of time is that the most enjoyable projects were projects that didn't follow this format. The Decal Tricks, 1 Flag CTF, Breakout Initiative, etc. became the most enjoyable projects because the entire team worked together and truly built a team building experience. Moving forward our goal is to get more people into a single lobby to work on a single project regularly to promote this team building experience.

Goals of the New Philosophy
---

 - Turn the Beta stage into a transition stage with a clear goal of completion
 - Reduce the amount of work for an Artist at the Beta stage
 - Create true contrast between Betas and Releases
 - Introduce Leads for a project to guide direction, not do most of the work
 - Change responsibility of projects to be more team oriented
 - Reduce the goal of a sprint to a single Release for the entire team
 - Add assistance in prototype completion into the focus of sprints
 - Improve content visibility to the community
 - Increase the priority of community feedback
 - Enable regular posting of progression of development to the community
 - Give Designers resources to complete prototypes; especially new game modes
 - Provide individual incentive with the entire team's focus for one's project
 - Avoid being held back from publishing by administrative tasks
 - Allow for more focus on key elements by reducing goals of each stage
 - Enable automation for moving through the pipeline using clearer goals
 - Clarify what traps exist at each stage that pull attention from goals
 - Provide incentive for external project participation using team building
 - Encourage more exploration of unassigned roles (artists as designers)

The New Philosophy
---

All content stages have much clearer goals. Ideas are about brainstorming, Prototypes are about playability, Alphas are about perfected gameplay, Betas are about defining an aesthetic, and Releases are about making it mind blowing. This is very similar to what we had before, except for Betas.

The way we are keeping Betas from getting out of control is using a guideline around avoiding adding new pieces/geometry to a Beta. If you are adding new pieces or geometry (even railings) then you are getting away from the goal of the Beta stage. With new Forge tools we are able to define an identity without adding new pieces. During Beta the goal will be to ONLY texture pieces, color pieces, change map filters/effects, do global lighting, change the skybox (this includes surrounding with chromas), etc. These are all fairly manual tasks that shouldn't take too long. The end quality of a Beta should be about the visual detail of Halo: CE. This is also an easy task to share with other team members, but ultimately the Lead Artist is responsible for the completion of this task. This provides the skeleton for the content's aesthetic by defining things like each area's purpose, the entire map color palette, and basic textures tied to each color.

The moment this process is done and there are no textures, colors, lighting, etc. to change and the Artist is itching to add new pieces, we verify that the content is still playable and then we release that version (0.##.0) to content hubs like Forgehub as a WIP. Putting out a WIP before the Beta stage would accomplish very little as most Alphas should look the same as they are all completed Blockouts. The goal of the Beta is to make those Blockouts different from each other and give the content an identity. Because of the new goals of a Beta, a piece of content should be able to go from Alpha to Beta in a matter of a couple of days.

This shift in goals for a Beta enables many things. More WIPs will be put out to content hubs (could be labeled with [CF WIP]). The names of the Lead Designer and Lead Artist will be attached to the WIP so more recognition for them. WIPs don't need very detailed writeups and can build over time. After the map has moved to Beta and is public, we are now able to post development screenshots as the map gets more fancy. Doing things like transforming a stone room into having a fireplace, tables, chairs, and a chandelier is easy to share. This added sharing also enables more visibility by providing bumps to the WIP threads. With the WIP out there, we are also able to bring the content to more community testing allowing for more community feedback.

Before every sprint the managers work with the team to decide which piece of content we focus on. Every sprint will have a single Release as a team goal. This Release will be the core focus of the sprint and all team members will be encouraged to participate. Multiple large team lobbies will get together to Forge on the Release for the sprint, guided by the Lead Designer and Lead Artist for the project. This is similar to how we worked on the Decal Tricks project, the Beta for Siren, and several other team oriented projects. As secondary team tasks throughout the sprint, team members will also be encouraged to work on completing prototypes as a lot of work needs to go into new ideas (map layouts, game modes, etc.) to make them playable. And as individual time goes, individuals will continue to refine Alphas they are Lead Designer for, and complete Betas that they are Lead Artist for.

An important topic for content philosophy is incentive for completion at each stage. At the Idea stage the incentive for the Team is exploring the excitement of the idea. At the Alpha stage the incentive for the Lead Designer is acquiring a Lead Artist to guide the map to finish. At the Beta stage the incentive for the Lead Artist is to make the work public and get full blown team support for a future sprint. At Release the incentive for the Team is to have fun with the rest of the Team as we make a piece of content the best that it can be ready to show off to the world.

For final publishing, Releases are compiled together while the map is being worked on by the team. By the time writeups are needed, there should be a ton of development notes and a ton of development screenshots. The Release will be put out by the Creative Force gamertag and the only attribution will be towards the team itself. Not even the Lead Designer or Lead Artist will be recognized at release. They are in charge of the development process, but in terms of the content as a whole, the team is who gets attribution. Individuals aren't on Creative Force for fame or glory for themselves. The only reason that Lead Designers and Lead Artists are mentioned in the WIP is because they are who needs to be worked with to make decisions over the development process.

Future Philosophy
---

The goal of this shift in philosophy is to solve the bottleneck existing in the Beta phase. As a team we are extremely familiar with the art portion of content creation. Our goal is to smooth out the issues with that portion before we move onto the next major issues in the content pipeline.

The first expected major issue will be the Idea/Prototype/Alpha stages relating to the actual generation of content. This is still ultimately a solo process and several members are capable of completely putting together a blockout on their own in 30 minutes. Ideally this becomes a team process rather than a single individual spitting out their ideas. This may be our next major focus. I expect something along the lines of a design document stating goals for a layout before creating the layout will be the best way to begin to approach this.

Another expected major issue is handling publishing and how we assist non-developers in completing their tasks. It can be difficult to gain notes for write ups and developmental screenshots. The current change in philosophy should definitely help this so this current change may be enough to make publishing a non-issue. Because more WIP threads will exist and more WAYWO posts will be put out, this will serve as valuable content for the publishing team when they go to make a write up.
