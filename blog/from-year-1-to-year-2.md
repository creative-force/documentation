It's been a while since I've written to the community about CF, so if you don't know what CF is there is a brief overview below. We are hitting a point where we are ready to grow yet again and take on more team members. We've had amazing success behind the scenes, and our next goal is to ensure that everyone on the team is having their work publicized for everyone to see in a more efficient manner. Our publishing and marketing portion is lacking, but it won't be for long. And soon after that our potential for output will only increase so we'll need more designers and developers too. Read on for the whole scoop...


What we are

Creative Force is a team of Forge communnity members working to collaborate to put out a steady stream of content. But we do things differently... like a game development team we take pick of a set of responsibilities for each part of content creation, but we never work on a project alone or on every part of creation. We've created a system of shared investment where you aren't the only person who wants the project complete. We do this by sharing responsibilities on a project and enforcing a minimum of two people to work on a piece of content (at least one designer and one developer). In addition those involved with publishing or management are just as invested to see the project through as the rest of the team.

Our typical process looks like this: several designers will work on blockouts (a sloppy layout of essentially primitives, quickly made to test with no concern for art, bugs, or polish) and test them with as many people as possible. When a blockout is addictive to play without any art then we put it as "ready for art". We work as a team to decide an art direction for the blockout. Eventually an artist picks up the blockout and works hand-in-hand with the designer to ensure key gameplay elements stay in-tact while realizing the art direction and bringing it to life. When art is done and testing ensures gameplay has remained true, it is ready for publishing. Those in charge of publishing assist with screenshots, write ups, and post formatting. Then it is posted to the appropriate outlets as a WIP Beta to get community feedback (Waypoint, Forgehub, Reddit, etc.). We rinse and repeat this process doing a second art pass, adjusting for feedback, testing, and publishing until we finally fully release the piece of content.


Where we are

We have been doing this since I put out that initial idea of building a production team back on October 15, 2015. We are heading towards only a year later and we currently have 18 active members (I just trimmed our roster of inactives). We currently have 42 projects between "ready for art" and "fully published" with dozens and dozens more being tested, designed, and brainstormed into existence. 10 of those 42 projects have reached fully published. We've nailed down the ideation and development segments of our content pipeline. Our next focus is to build up our publishing segment. Right now we have a couple writers, our managers, and various team members helping with publishing, but only those couple of writers are dedicated to actual publishing tasks. So we are looking to take on people to help focus on that portion of the pipeline (things like screenshots, writing, posting, social networking, etc). In the second post you'll find several roles we are looking to fill, mostly for publishing but we are always looking for more designers, developers, and QA managers so you'll find those roles as well.

Another part of the pipeline we are exploring is our innovation segment. This involves new mini-game ideas, mechanic discovery, and full blown new game modes like Grifball, Conquest, and Ricochet. We have a very specific section that has dozens of new ideas, but requires know how, time, and testing. This segment requires focused and logical minds that are very familiar with the Halo scripting engine and its possibilities. We have extremely clever and innovative members busy with other responsibilities, and having several people focused specifically on designing mechanisms to make these crazy ideas work would be extremely valuable. This segment also includes taking these mechanisms and making them easy to use for regular forgers in the form of prefabs, assistance, and tutorials. The best part of being located in Creative Force, is that when an idea pans out and is a blast to play, we have an entire team able to push out a variety of content for the new idea (new maps and variants). Many have witnessed our ability to put out tons of Breakout and Grifball maps and this ability can be utilized for new game modes.

A note about being a part of the team. While each person holds different sets of responsibilities, no single person is kept from doing what they want. If you are a writer and have an idea for a layout, you are free to build that layout and work with our designers to get more eyes on it. Or if you are sick of designing blockouts you are free to act as the artist on another project. Every team member has specialties, but we don't hold back the solo forger in you. We do want to help you channel particular skills and make your ideas the best that they can possibly be. And there is no major time commitment, this is a fully volunteer based team. The goal of the team is that if someone can't finish it someone else will pick it up.


What you get

What we provide is enablement for each other. Creating content is hard. It isn't easy to design a layout, build a blockout, test, do art, ensure quality, do a write up, take screenshots, publish to websites, market your content, and maintain it all at once. That's why I created this team, so we don't have to do it all and we aren't the only ones who care. A single person can get burned out at a particular part of the process and stuck and never release content. We get that and the shared investment of a project means that we will eventually see it through to the end and assist each other when we get in a rut. With this support system our team has developed into sort of a family that we can rely on.

In addition to the support of a team, we provide an organized process that we've refined over the past year. We track all of our projects on Trello, communicate with Slack, and regularly refine our process when we notice a bottleneck. This organization allows us to enable multiple people to work on a single project which has benefits that come back tenfold. Because of this we can also automate multiple parts of the process. We have talented software engineers on the team that are already working on automation to make everyone's job easier. In the future this will truly speed up and improve our ability to build content.

And finally you get a brand and a home. We've been around for a year, we have our hand in various pots, and we do our best to add value to the community at large. From the Decal Trick to Attack/Defend Breakout to working closely with ATN to several of our members being staff at Forgehub. We went from a fairly negative reputation to a very positive one. We love being part of the community and building it up rather than segmenting it so we make sure to stay a part of Forgehub.

I hope you'll take some time to consider jumping on board as we enter another growth phase. The success the team has had together has been amazing and I've never been a part of a more positive and supportive team. I'm proud of our current accomplishments and I hope we can share this with even more people.
