Making sure to follow this format makes the publishers job much easier as it guarantees that they have the information they need to publish the map and we won't have issues like we did with the first sprint. 

***CARD TITLE***

_____________________________________________________________________

***Notes:***

vX.XX.XX is the version number, it may only be 3 digits (ex. v0.2.1), but could have double digit iterations (ex. v0.13.0). It is important to consider this as you are creating the description so that a version number doesn't ruin a description you spent time to create and make fit in the character limit.

If the map is a remake, the title should be prefaced:

Halo:CE -> "CE - "
Halo 2 -> "H2 - "
Halo 3 -> "H3 - "
Halo 4 -> "H4 - "
Halo: CE Anniversary -> "CE:A - "
Halo: 2 Anniversary -> "H2:A - "

Ex: "H2 - Coagulation", "H2 - Turf"

If the map is in Beta, the title should be followed by "(Beta)".

Ex: "H2 - Turf (Beta)", Evergreen (Beta)
