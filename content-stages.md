Idea - Existence
---

The Idea stage is all about bringing content into Existence.

Ideas are the initial conception of content. For Creative Force, map ideas are created in the Sandbox and concept ideas in the Mindbox (modes, mini-games, mechanics). This is the stage for brainstorming. Individuals on the team work together to build on the idea if it sparks interest in them. This brainstorming can lead to several light bulbs that can mature the idea to the point where it makes sense to build a Prototype. The goal of this stage is to explore the idea as much as possible. Quantity of ideas is the #1 priority.

_Required_
 - Initial description on the Trello card of what inspired the idea and what the idea entails

_Optional_
 - Reference media (videos, screenshots, articles, etc)

_Avoid_
 - Staying attached to the original idea, sometimes amazing things can spark from the initial idea that are no where near the original idea
 - Not mentioning ideas, these turn into possible missed opportunities; your ideas no matter how irrelevant could spark new conversations that end up in the final product



Prototype - Acknowledgement
---

Prototypes are all about getting acknowledgement that the content exists and is doable.

Prototypes are the building of the first playable version of the content. This is where initial mechanisms must be worked out and initial layout is built in the blandest of forms. Speed is one of the goals of this stage. The faster you get a playable version the better. Playability should be the #1 priority, nothing else should come before making it playable (no art, smoothing, lighting, redoing spawns, cameras, etc.).

_Required_
 - Create a piece a playable piece of content
 - Versioning should be 0.0.## as there is no playable version until it is done
 - Final product is represented as "<Content Name> 0.1.0" putting it into an Alpha state

_Optional_
 - Nothing is optional at this stage as the goal is to make this playable as quick as possible.

_Avoid_
 - Attention to detail, the goal of this is to be fast to playability.
