Idea - Existence
---

The Idea stage is all about bringing content into Existence.

Ideas are the initial conception of content. For Creative Force, map ideas are created in the Sandbox and concept ideas in the Mindbox (modes, mini-games, mechanics). This is the stage for brainstorming. Individuals on the team work together to build on the idea if it sparks interest in them. This brainstorming can lead to several light bulbs that can mature the idea to the point where it makes sense to build a Prototype. The goal of this stage is to explore the idea as much as possible. Quantity of ideas is the #1 priority.

_Required_
 - Initial description on the Trello card of what inspired the idea and what the idea entails

_Flexible_
 - Reference media (videos, screenshots, articles, etc)

_Avoid_
 - Staying attached to the original idea, sometimes amazing things can spark from the initial idea that are no where near the original idea
 - Not mentioning ideas, these turn into possible missed opportunities; your ideas no matter how irrelevant could spark new conversations that end up in the final product



Prototype - Acknowledgement
---

Prototypes are all about getting acknowledgement that the content exists and is doable.

Prototypes are the building of the first playable version of the content. This is where initial mechanisms must be worked out and initial layout is built in the blandest of forms. Speed is one of the goals of this stage. The faster you get a playable version the better. Playability should be the #1 priority, nothing else should come before making it playable (no art, smoothing, lighting, redoing spawns, cameras, etc.).

_Required_
 - Create a piece a playable piece of content
 - Versioning should be 0.0.## as there is no playable version until it is done
 - Final product is represented as "<Content Name> 0.1.0" putting it into an Alpha state

_Flexible_
 - Nothing is flexible at this stage as the goal is to make this playable as quick as possible.

_Avoid_
 - Attention to detail, the goal of this is to be fast to playability.
 - Feature creep; focus on building the initial idea and don't modify it as you are building, unless the current idea is literally unplayable (you can't even start the game).


Alpha - Soul
---

Alphas are about building the best soul for content, as what's inside is what matters most.

Alphas are about polishing your prototype in terms of the game rules. Exploring additional routes, figuring out minor settings, or communicating information. The goal of an Alpha is making the content have replayability. People should be excited about another play on the map. "Come for the aesthetics, stay for the gameplay" is a motto that should be kept in mind. Building that "soul" of the content is what makes it ready for Beta. Keep fast iteration in mind. Changes in this stage are quick, easy, and cheap and it is harder to be invested in a setion. As soon as art is done, its hard to change something pretty. So make 99% of gameplay changes now.

_Required_
 - Tons of testing is played on it
 - Gameplay must be addicting to play over and over again; the content should immerse you with gameplay alone
 - Every logical game mode objective should be setup as that is part of the gameplay
 - Cameras should be setup statically as cameras impart important information that cannot be untested
 - An art direction needs to be decided on
 - Final product is represented as "<Content Name> 0.#.0" as it is playable and has gone through many iterations

_Flexible_
 - Gather additional art reference images for the Environment Artist
 - Document gameplay notes for use in publishing later
 - Capture screenshots of the content at rest and in action

_Avoid_
 - Doing anything related to visual quality; every change should be based on gameplay
 - Minimal testing; this should be the most playtested phase in the entire pipeline
