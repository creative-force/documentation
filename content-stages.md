Idea - Existence
---

The Idea stage is all about bringing content into Existence.

Ideas are the initial conception of content. For Creative Force, map ideas are created in the Sandbox and concept ideas in the Mindbox (modes, mini-games, mechanics). This is the stage for brainstorming. Individuals on the team work together to build on the idea if it sparks interest in them. This brainstorming can lead to several light bulbs that can mature the idea to the point where it makes sense to build a Prototype.

Requirements
 - Initial description on the Trello card of what inspired the idea and what the idea entails

Optional
 - Reference media (videos, screenshots, articles, etc)
