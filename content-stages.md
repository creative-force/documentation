Idea - Existence
---

The Idea stage is all about bringing content into Existence.

Ideas are the initial conception of content. For Creative Force, map ideas are created in the Sandbox and concept ideas in the Mindbox (modes, mini-games, mechanics). This is the stage for brainstorming. Individuals on the team work together to build on the idea if it sparks interest in them. This brainstorming can lead to several light bulbs that can mature the idea to the point where it makes sense to build a Prototype. The goal of this stage is to explore the idea as much as possible. Quantity of ideas is the #1 priority.

**Every Idea is the responsibility of the original person with the idea, OR the Lead Designer picking up the project. They should be working with the team and Innovation Specialists to assist in the feasibility and brainstorming of the idea.**

_Required_
 - Initial description on the Trello card of what inspired the idea and what the idea entails

_Flexible_
 - Reference media (videos, screenshots, articles, etc)
 - Creation of a Game Design Document to officially document possibilities

_Traps_
 - Staying attached to the original idea; sometimes amazing things can spark from the initial idea that are no where near the original idea
 - Not mentioning ideas, these turn into possible missed opportunities; your ideas no matter how irrelevant could spark new conversations that end up in the final product

Prototype - Acknowledgement
---

Prototypes are all about getting acknowledgement that the content exists and is doable.

Prototypes are the building of the first playable version of the content. This is where initial mechanisms must be worked out and initial layout is built in the blandest of forms. Speed is one of the goals of this stage. The faster you get a playable version the better. Playability should be the #1 priority, nothing else should come before making it playable (no art, smoothing, lighting, redoing spawns, cameras, etc.).

**Every prototype is a team responsibility. As ideas are put together, sometimes it can be difficult to get new mechanisms or map segments in place and the Lead Designer needs all the help they can get.**

_Required_
 - Create a playable piece of content
 - Versioning should be 0.0.## as there is no playable version until it is done
 - Final product is represented as "<Content Name> 0.1.0" putting it into an Alpha state

_Flexible_
 - Nothing is flexible at this stage as the goal is to make this playable as quick as possible.

_Traps_
 - Attention to detail, the goal of this is to be fast to playability.
 - Feature creep; focus on building the initial idea and don't modify it as you are building, unless the current idea is literally unplayable (you can't even start the game)

Alpha - Soul
---

Alphas are about building the best soul for content, as what's inside is what matters most.

Alphas are about polishing your prototype in terms of the game rules. Exploring additional routes, figuring out minor settings, or communicating information. In Creative Force when a Prototype becomes playable, we move it from the Sandbox/Mindbox into the Alphas list. The goal of an Alpha is making the content have replayability. People should be excited about another play on the content. "Come for the aesthetics, stay for the gameplay" is a motto that should be kept in mind. Building that "soul" of the content is what makes it ready for Beta. Keep fast iteration in mind. Changes in this stage are quick, easy, and cheap. At this stage it is harder to be invested in a setion making it more likely that you will make changes for the better. As soon as art is done, its hard to change something pretty. So make 99% of gameplay changes now.

**Every Alpha is the responsibility of the Lead Designer. The Lead Designer should be working with team and personal resources to coordinate testing and adjust for feedback.**

_Required_
 - Tons of testing is played on it
 - Gameplay must be addicting to play over and over again; the content should immerse you with gameplay alone
 - Every logical game mode objective should be setup as that is part of the gameplay
 - Cameras should be setup statically as cameras impart important information that cannot be untested
 - Name zones volumes exist over 80% of the map (names need not be final)
 - The map is 80% contained (focus on just big blockers as the map will still be changing in art)
 - An art direction needs to be decided on as a team
 - Final product is represented as "<Content Name> 0.#.0" as it is playable and has gone through many iterations

_Flexible_
 - Gather additional art reference images for the Environment Artist
 - Document gameplay notes for use in publishing later
 - Capture screenshots of the content at rest and in action

_Traps_
 - Doing anything related to visual quality; every change should be based on gameplay
 - Minimal testing; this should be the most playtested phase in the entire pipeline
 - Animating cameras as camera animation should take into account the art and will just have to be redone when art is applied

Beta - Identity
---

Betas are about building a recognizable identity, as every Blockout in Alpha blurs together.

Betas are about making people remember a piece of content and building content recognition. In Creative Force, Betas are pulled from the Backlog into Beta Candidates when it is being worked on. When it is finished, it is moved to Beta publishing and a WIP thread is created for it. When a Beta is complete it is still considered a work in progress. The goal of a Beta is to ensure that when someone hear's the map name, they can actually remember it and imagine it visually. Despite being about building an identity, we still want the map to be crude. We still want to build a powerful contrast between a published Beta and a Release. In this stage we focus on changing colors, texturing, atmosphere, and player containment. The content should have the visual quality of about a Halo CE map.

**Every Beta is the responsibility of the Lead Environment Artist that picks it up from the Backlog. It is the Lead Environment Artist's role to begin the aesthetic by doing a first art pass with texturing, coloring, atmosphere, global lighting, and landmarking.**

_Required_
 - Solidify a name for the content
 - Atmosphere is set (filters, map effects, blocking the sun, fog color, etc.)
 - Every piece's texturing, color, and overlay is considered
 - Every area is defined to have a specific purpose (engine room, dock, etc.)
 - A minimal WIP writeup is done with the design and art direction
 - Map is saved with the name of "<Content Name> 1.0.0"
 - Development screenshots are taken of the Beta
 - A WIP thread is posted on Forgehub

_Flexible_
 - Playtest infrequently to verify gameplay and to stir up some interest
 - Bring to community test lobbies for feedback
 - Keep track of ideas you may have for detailing an area
 - Test with higher skilled halo community members
 - Adjust Name Zones

_Traps_
 - Adding anything more than atmosphere, texturing, global lighting, and landmarking
 - Adding any additional forge objects that are not just intended for pure substitution
 - Adjusting cameras with animations (we want to keep it crude)

Release - Style
---

Releases are about blowing people's mind with how much the map's style has changed since Beta.

Releases are the final product, until the content is revisited. We want to make Releases actually matter, and to do this the previous stages need to be the worst they can possibly be while achieving their goals. We want people to be relatively interested in maps at the Beta/WIP stage, but when they finally get to see the final product their jaw should drop. This is the stage that takes the most time. Detailing should be done on the map and in the skybox, cameras should gain animation to introduce a dynamic feel, and every little bit of z-fighting and texture is perfected.

**Every Release is a team responsibility led by the Lead Designer and Lead Environment Artist. Team members should gather regularly to visually upgrade every section of the map to the best of their abilities and find places where polish should be applied.**

_Required_
 - If applicable, Lore should exist for the content
 - Finalize name zones
 - Each spawn point and weapon is carefully tweaked for a good experience
 - Cameras are animated to add a dynamic touch
 - Detail lighting handled to heighten mood, and designate areas
 - Sound effects added to improve atmostphere and immersion
 - Special effects added where necessary
 - Decals and other detailing added to enhance the experience
 - Lightmap reduced to below 100%
 - Map saved as "<Content Name>" with version 2.0.0 in the description
 - Beta writeup is added to with additional development notes from the team
 - A short in-game description is created
 - Five final Screenshots are taken on the Creative Force gamertag
 - Map is fully saved on the Creative Force gamertag
 - Map is tagged appropriately
 - The five final Screenshots are processed into marketing material
 - Make a Content post to the FH Database
 - Share map on Reddit and Twitter

_Flexible_
 - Post progress pictures from crappy Beta to fancy Release
 - Post updated playable versions to the WIP thread (version represented as 1.#.0)
 - Contact youtube channels about upcoming release
 - After release, make minor changes to the core version without overriding it or saving a new version
 - Share with your friends and family on Facebook
 - Make a video of it ourselves

_Traps_
 - Never releasing (you can always come back to it)
 - Putting the work into a Release before working on another piece of content that a team member needs help with
